                  <p>
                      Welcome to Y-Technologies. </br>
                      I'm founder of Y-Technologies.I'm a Network and System Engineer before.
                      In the year 2019 , I decided to change career to Cloud. 
                      On the other hand , It's time to say "Bye Bye" to my "Cisco Network Engineer" career.
                      It's sure , I will forget some networking concept when I stop my career.
                      So....I decided again to left Videos tutorial for Future Network Engineers.
                      I created a page on facebook to share my videos and gave a name as IT_Side_MM.</br>
                      But I revoked it.</br>
                      I created a Youtube channel and gave the name as Y-Technologies and also created a page for networking Videos , name is "What is Networking?".
                      After 2 years later ,  I created another page for Cloud Computing Vidoes , gave a name as "Cloud 77 for Burmese." </br>
                      Even I have alot of videos on different pages , all vidoes are available on Y-Technologies youtube channel.
                      Some people requested to our page to open the classes , so we started our very first "Networking Class" in the year 2021 , May. And then , we extend our classes and course.
